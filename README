========================================================================

Notre Dame Information Network Analysis Toolkit (NINA) is a general purpose 
system for analysis and manipulation of large networks.

Some of applications expect that GnuPlot and GraphViz are installed and
accessible -- paths are in the system PATH variable or they reside in the
working directory.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

NINA is based in large part on the JGraphT system, which is licensed under 
LGPL v2.1. Also, large portions of NINA also include ports from the MALLET
toolkit, which is released under the Common Public License (CPL) and the 
SNAP project, which is released under the BSD License. 

Because LGPL is a bit more restrictive, and because NINA is mostly based on
JGraphT we have licensed this software under LGPL.
